A) Introduction and AI-mechanism

This is a simple form of an chess-computer, which works with a 5th degree forwardthinking.
That means it calculates 5 moves before it actualy moves. The move executed is determined by evaluating all end-of-tree moves
and choosing the best one by min-maxing.
For evaluating a combination of two techniques is use:
    1. For each piece it is calculated which pieces of the own are shielded and which pieces of the enemy are attacked.
       Those values are added together where the values of the enemy pieces are multiplied by -1.
    2. It is calculated which pieces are missing in comparison with the monantaneous state.
       The sum of those values is calculated where the own losses are multiplied with -1.

B) Representation of the field

The field positions are represented by a linear array:

       00w 01b 02w 03b 04w 05b 06w 07b
       08b 09w 10b 11w 12b 13w 14b 15w
       16w 17b 18w 19b 20w 21b 22w 23b
       24b 25w 26b 27w 28b 29w 30b 31w
       32w 33b 34w 35b 36w 37b 38w 39b
       40b 41w 42b 43w 44b 45w 46b 47w
       48w 49b 50w 51b 52w 53b 54w 55b
       56b 57w 58b 59w 60b 61w 62b 63w

The white pieces are starting at the bottom (positions 48-63) and the black at the top (positions 0-15).

In case the human player picks black the matrix is turned around for the drawing, so the pieces of the human player are always
at the bottom.
That means also that in case the local multiplayer is used the "board" is turned after every move..
